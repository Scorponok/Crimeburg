Crimeburg
=========

Welcome to Crimeburg, PA!

Your great-great-grandfather was a refugee from Europe, and one of those who helped found the town of "Kremeburg" (known for the delicious cream produced by its cows) upon his arrival in the United States. Your family has lived here ever since, but you've never been able to fit into any of the family businesses - you just feel like there's something more to life than this.

It's 1919, and you have your chance. Prohibition has passed, and Speakeasies are popping up all over the country. Now is the perfect time for someone of loose moral fiber to stake out their own turf.
