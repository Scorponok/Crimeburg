Game Mechanics
==============

Robbing houses is represented by a mini-game where you spend dice from a pool. Every month you get a new "pool" of dice to use for crimes. You can spend as many of these dice as you want on any particular robbery, but you're limited overall by the pool you have. Different houses take different amounts of dice to rob. You can upgrade your dice pool as you play.

E.g. if your pool has 4d6 in it, you can "spend" (roll) 2 of them to try and rob a house. The more dice you spend, the higher your roll will be, and the better you'll do.

This should replace the "rent" mechanic for making the user go on to additional months. Once you run out of dice, you can't really do anything else, so you have to proceed to the next month.

You're rolling against a target number that can depend on the type of crime you're trying to commit, and the type / level of the building you're attempting it on. For example, trying to rob a slum would be a lot easier than trying to rob a mansion, but if you could pull it off, robbing the mansion would be a lot more lucrative.


Progression
===========

At the start of the game, the player should expect to begin by robbing easy targets, 1 per turn. As things progress, they build up their arsenal of dice and can begin robbing multiple targets, or start planning more complex crimes, or rob more valuable targets.


Specific numbers
================

Ballpark numbers for stuff:

* Slums roll 1d6 + level for defense.
* Houses roll 2d6 + level for defense.
* Mansions roll 4d6 + level for defense.

That means a slum will be rolling something like 1d6+3 (~6), a house will be rolling around 2d6+7 (~14), and a mansion will be rolling 4d6+11 (~25).

That means 2d6 should generally beat a slum, 4d6 should generally beat a house, 8d6 should generally beat a mansion. (Maybe want to increase those numbers at the higher end?)


Ideas
=====

? Different dice values or types needed for different crimes?

? Different dice that are better than different crimes?

? Save dice from month to month?

? Different pool sizes at different stages of the game?

? Houses "roll" dice as well, maybe different numbers or sizes of dice? Depending on the level of the house?

? You progress by being able to rob bigger and better houses

? Your pool goes up as you play (in number or size?)

? Levelling up lets you choose pool advancements (number or size?) Maybe a skill tree?

? Special dice that have other effects than just numbers?

? "Spend" dice to take over buildings? Even e.g. the police?
